# JSON Data

This package includes data classes used to hold data
that is serialized to JSON, or de-serialized from JSON.

The Java classes are a type of object called a POJO,
which is short for "Plain Old Java Object."

These classes were generated by the web site
http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/, which allows you to
input properly-formatted JSON and download pre-made
POJO class definitions for your Java project.
